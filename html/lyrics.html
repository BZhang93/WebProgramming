<p>There's a fire starting in my heart,<br/>
Reaching a fevered pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.<br/>
Finally, I can see you crystal clear,<br/>
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,<br/> 
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,<br/>
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.</p> 

<p>There's a fire starting in my heart,<br/>
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.</p>

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, 
I can't help feeling, 

We could have had it all, 
(Your gonna wish you, never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told, 
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn, 
Think of me in the depths of your despair, 
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
I can't help feeling, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all, 
Rolling in the deep, 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door, 
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold, 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all.
(You're gonna wish you never had met me), 
It all, it all, it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) 
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
(You're gonna wish you never had met me

But you played it, 
You played it, 
You played it, 
You played it to the beat.
