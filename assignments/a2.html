<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>Program with JavaScript.</li>
<li>Use the Document Object Model.</li>
<li>Render 2D graphics on the web browser with HTML5's canvas.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The title of this assignment says it all.  In this assignment, you will start to build a working version of Frogger using JavaScript, playable on the web browser.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to maneuver the frog using the arrow keys UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from the bottom of the screen to cross the busy road, across the river, and to one of the pads --without getting run over by a vehicle, drown, or eaten by an alligator.</p>
<p><img src="../images/frogger.png" alt="frogger" /></p>
<p>If you have never played Frogger before, you can play it online at <a href="http://www.playfrogger.org/">http://www.playfrogger.org/</a>.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You will write one file: <code>game.js</code>.  This file will contain all the game logic including initialization, rendering all the graphics, handing keypresses, and animation.</p>

<p class="stress">For this assignment, you will write the methods to initialize a game and draw the graphics to the canvas.</p>
<p>Your method to draw the graphics must draw:</p>
<ol>
<li>The water.  Use color code <code>#191970</code> for blue.</li>
<li>The road. Use the color code <code>"#000000"</code> for black.</li>
<li>The header "Frogger"</li>
<li>The purple roadsides</li>
<li>The footer containing the lives remaining as represented by the number of frogs, the level number, the score, and the high score</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, it should look something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="../images/frogger-a2.png" alt="level"</p>

<p>Please also render the following items in your draw method:</p>
<ul>
<li>A frog at the bottom roadside facing upwards (i.e., its starting position)</li>
<li>Two vehicles (your choice from sprite sheet) anywhere on the road</li>
<li>A log (your choice from sprite sheet) somewhere in the water</li>
</ul>

<p>Programming should be done on your local computer.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Starting with this assignment, you will be provided a <span class="stress">private</span> GitHub repo for submitting assignments.  You will be emailed the name of your private repo.  This email will be sent to you at the e-mail address you provided in Lab 1.  The only two people who will have access to this special repo will be me (the instructor), the TAs, and you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check your email for the name of your private repository. Make sure you can see it under your list of repositories by logging on to GitHub.</li>
<li>Make a clone of your private repository (which will be initially empty) onto your computer.</li>
<li>Download and unzip the file <code><a href="frogger.zip">frogger.zip</a></code> directly into your private repository.</li>
<li>Remove the ZIP file <code>frogger.zip</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You are provided with five files:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>index.html</code> - HTML page with a canvas</li>
<li><code>style.css</code> - The stylesheet</li>
<li><code>assets/dead_frog.png</code> - Image of the frog getting killed; to be used when frog is run over by a vehicle, eaten, or drowns.</li>
<li><code>assets/frogger_sprites.png</code> - A sprite sheet containing all the images, sprites, necessary for the game.</li>
<li><code>game.js</code> - Where you will write all your JavaScript code.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">You are not allowed to create additional stylesheets or HTML files.</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>Before a game begins, a number of parameters must be initialized to certain values.  These parameters can be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting x-coordinate of the frog</li>
<li>Starting y-coordinate of the frog</li>
<li>The number of lives (typically 3 lives to start with)</li>
<li>Is game over? (i.e., you have no more lives left)</li>
<li>Level number</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Locations of vehicles</li>
<li>Locations of logs</li>
<li>Speed of vehicles</li>
<li>Speed of logs</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many other game parameters that I did not list.</p>

<h2>About Sprite Sheets</h2>
<p>One of the issues that you discovered in Lab 2 is that when assets are loaded for a web page (e.g., images, stylesheets), a lot of time is spent on waiting, the time between sending the HTTP request and receiving an HTTP response.  Games typically use lots of images.  If there are lots of individual images to be downloaded, then the total amount of time spent waiting will be high.  A way to alleviate the waiting problem is to only have one image, but the image contains all the images necessary for the game.  This image is better known as a <span class="stress">sprite sheet</span>.  In this assignment, the image <code>assets/frogger_sprites.png</code> is a sprite sheet.</p>

<h2>The JavaScript Canvas API</h2>
<p>A canvas is simply a drawing area.  HTML5 introduces a new element called <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>.  Drawing can be done onto the canvas via of the JavaScript Canvas API.  The Canvas API contains many powerful methods: from drawing lines to image manipulation.</p>
<p>The API also contains a method, <code>drawImage()</code> that allows <span class="stress">slicing</span> an image.  That is, only draw parts of an image onto the canvas.  Please refer to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_drawimage.asp" target="blank">http://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_drawimage.asp</a> for the parameters and usage of <code>drawImage()</code>.  To get the coordinates (in pixels) of the part of the image you want to render, you can use tools such as Preview on Mac OS X, Gimp, or Photoshop.</p>
<p>There is an excellent tutorial on the JavaScript Canvas API through Mozilla at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Tutorial" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Tutorial</a></p>
<p>The <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is initially blank, and to display something a script (your <code>game.js</code>) first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. The canvas element has a DOM method called <code>getContext()</code>, used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions. <code>getContext()</code> takes one parameter, the type of context.</p>
<pre>
canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
</pre>

<h2>Preparing for Part II</h2>
<p>Games require animation, and animation requires constant drawing (also known as redrawing).  Other frequently executed tasks in a game include updating (e.g., updating the location of all the items in the game) and initialization (e.g., putting the character at a particular starting position).  Therefore, it is important that your code for this assignment is well thought out and implemented as it will be reused for the next assignment.  For sure, your drawing and initialization methods will be called and reused constantly.</p>

<h2>Calling a JavaScript Function On Page Load</h2>
<p>When a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, JavaScript files, CSS files, etc.), you can execute JavaScript code immediately via the <code>onload</code> attribute for the <code>body</code> element.  That is:</p>

<pre>
&lt;body onload="<span class="stress">SomeJavaScriptCodeOrFunction</span>"&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Viewing Your Work</h2>
<p>Open the <code>index.html</code> file on a web browser on your web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer)</p>
<p class="note">For obvious reasons, you are not allowed to make your work publicly accessibly on the web --yet.</p>

<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Every assignment shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (thus <code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (thus <code>README.md</code>). No other formats will be accepted.</li>
</ol>

<!-- So I ripped this off from Norman Ramsey at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/details.html -->
<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The Late Policy</h2>
<p>Homework that is submitted electronically (most homework) will typically be due at 11:59 PM on a Monday or Wednesday or at 5:59 PM on a Friday. We will grant an automatic extension of ten minutes at no cost to you. If you plan on submitting your work at midnight or at six, you will have nine minutes for last-minute changes.</p>
<p>Homework is expected to be submitted on time. However, we recognize that the exigencies of college life occasionally interfere with on-time submission. If you have difficulty getting homework in on time, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ordinary difficulties, each student is automatically issued six "extension tokens." By expending an extension token, you can get an automatic 24-hour extension on all deadlines associated with a single assignment.  To use an extension token, you must e-mail me at <code>mchow@cs.tufts.edu</code>. Thus must be sent before the assignment is due.  At most two extension tokens may be expended on any single assignment.  When you are out of tokens, late homework will no longer be accepted: it will be returned ungraded, and you will receive no credit for the work.</li>
<li>If a serious illness affects your ability to complete homework on time, your first step is to report the illness using the "Illness Notification Form" that is available in WebCenter for Students. We will make suitable arrangements. For extraordinary difficulties, such as bereavement, family emergencies, or other extraordinary unpleasant events, your first step should be to make contact with your associate dean for undergraduate education. You must take this step before the assignment is due. Ask your dean to drop me an email or give me a call, and we will make special arrangements that are suited to your circumstances.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please understand that extension tokens are meant to be used.  That is, you will not receive any special bonus at the end of the course if you do not use any of your extension tokens.</p>
<p>Solutions to assignments and labs will not be posted for this course.</p>


<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>
<p>Push all the files to the private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>frogger</code>.  Say that your private repository is named <code>mchow-comp20</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>mchow-comp20/frogger</code>.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<ol>
<li>(5 points) A reusable method that draws all the required items on the canvas</li>
<li>(3 points) A reusable method to initialize game parameters</li>
<li>(2 points) Programming style - documentation addresses exactly the key issues, and degree of detail is exactly appropriate; well thought out and implemented code; well chosen names for functions and their parameters.</li>
