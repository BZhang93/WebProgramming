<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>Apply acquired JavaScript skills to write an HTML5 game.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will complete a working version of Frogger using JavaScript, playable on the web browser.</p>

<h2>Game Instructions</h2>
<p class="stress">(Instructions taken from <a href="" target="_blank">http://www.20goto10.co.uk/frogger/instructions.html</a>)</a></p>
<p>If you have never played Frogger before, you can play it online at <a href="http://www.playfrogger.org/">http://www.playfrogger.org/</a>.</p>

<p>You'll start the game with 5 frogs. The first frog is shown on the sidewalk below the traffic.</p>
<p>The object of the game is to hop as many frogs to safety as you can --and to score the most points along the way!</p>
<p>You maneuver Frogger using the arrow keys UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.</p>
<p>Frogger starts his perilous journey on the sidewalk, facing 5 lanes of cars and trucks. Try to get Frogger through the lanes of traffic. Traffic travels in alternative directions and at different speeds, so be careful! Frogger will get "splooched" if he touches any part of a vehicle or is run over.</p>
<p>The game ends when no frogs are left.</p>

<h2>Game Scoring</h2>
<p>Points accumulate as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Basic) Successfully jumping Frogger forward: 10 points</li>
<li>(Basic) Successfully jumping Frogger home: 50 points</li>
<li>(Basic) Successfully jumping 5 frogs home: 1000 points</li>
<li>(Additional) Taking a lady frog home: 200 points</li>
<li>(Additional) Eating a fly: 200 points</li>
<li>(Additional) Extra points for time left: 10 points per remaining second</li>
</ul>
<p>Every time you score 10,000 points and have fewer than 4 frogs left, you'll get another Frogger!</p>

<h2>Basic Requirements</h2>
<p>You will update your <code>game.js</code> file in your <code>frogger</code> directory (from your Assignment 2).  Updates that you will need to make include handling the keypresses and animation.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you are allowed to use jQuery.</p>
<p>Programming should be done on your local computer.</p>
<p class="note">You are not allowed to create additional stylesheets or HTML files.</p>
<p>At the very least, you must implement the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the game loads immediately on page load. That is, no refresh to load the game (unlike what many of you did in Assignment 2).</li>
<li>Move Frogger on the canvas using the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys on your keyboard.</li>
<li>Animate the vehicles and logs on the screen. For basic requirements, you are not required to have alligators, snakes, or turtles.</li>
<li>Collision detection: if Frogger is hit by a vehicle or hits water, then player loses a life.</li>
<li>Basic game scoring as illustrated above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementing the basic requirements along with updating the <code>README</code> will give you a grade of a "B-" (80%) for this assignment.</p>

<h2>Additional Implementations</h2>
<p>In order the achieve an "A" for this assignment, you must accomplish four (4) additional items of your choice from the following list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement a timer and the additional game scoring items as illustrated above</li>
<li>Animate Frogger to <code>dead_frog.png</code> if he gets run over by vehicle, eaten by alligator, hits water, or misses home</li>
<li>Sound (i.e., incorporate the game audio)</li>
<li>Implement level progression. That is, level starts at 1. After jumping 5 frogs home, increment level and make level progressively more difficult (e.g., make vehicles faster).</li>
<li>Incorporate alligators, snakes, and turtles into the game. Should Frogger collides with any of the reptiles, the player loses a life.</li>
<li>Incorporate a fly that shows up at random times. Should Frogger eats the fly, player earns 200 extra points.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">IMPORTANT: Your <code>README</code> must list the additional requirements implemented.</p>

<h2>The Game Loop</h2>

<h2>Animation</h2>

<h2>Collision Detection</h2>

<h2>Viewing Your Work</h2>
<p>Open the <code>index.html</code> file on a web browser on your web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer)</p>
<p class="note">For obvious reasons, you are not allowed to make your work publicly accessibly on the web --yet.</p>

<!-- So I ripped this off from Norman Ramsey at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/details.html -->
<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Every assignment shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (thus <code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (thus <code>README.md</code>). No other formats will be accepted.</li>
</ol>

<!-- So I ripped this off from Norman Ramsey at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/details.html -->
<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The Late Policy</h2>
<p>Homework that is submitted electronically (most homework) will typically be due at 11:59 PM on a Monday or Wednesday or at 5:59 PM on a Friday. We will grant an automatic extension of ten minutes at no cost to you. If you plan on submitting your work at midnight or at six, you will have nine minutes for last-minute changes.</p>
<p>Homework is expected to be submitted on time. However, we recognize that the exigencies of college life occasionally interfere with on-time submission. If you have difficulty getting homework in on time, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ordinary difficulties, each student is automatically issued six "extension tokens." By expending an extension token, you can get an automatic 24-hour extension on all deadlines associated with a single assignment.  To use an extension token, you must e-mail me at <code>mchow@cs.tufts.edu</code>. Thus must be sent before the assignment is due.  At most two extension tokens may be expended on any single assignment.  When you are out of tokens, late homework will no longer be accepted: it will be returned ungraded, and you will receive no credit for the work.</li>
<li>If a serious illness affects your ability to complete homework on time, your first step is to report the illness using the "Illness Notification Form" that is available in WebCenter for Students. We will make suitable arrangements. For extraordinary difficulties, such as bereavement, family emergencies, or other extraordinary unpleasant events, your first step should be to make contact with your associate dean for undergraduate education. You must take this step before the assignment is due. Ask your dean to drop me an email or give me a call, and we will make special arrangements that are suited to your circumstances.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please understand that extension tokens are meant to be used.  That is, you will not receive any special bonus at the end of the course if you do not use any of your extension tokens.</p>
<p>Solutions to assignments and labs will not be posted for this course.</p>

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>
<p>Same as Assignment 2. Push all your changes to the private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>frogger</code>.  Say that your private repository is named <code>mchow-comp20</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>mchow-comp20/frogger</code>.</p>
