<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>Apply acquired JavaScript skills to write an HTML5 game.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>


<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You will update your <code>game.js</code> file in your <code>frogger</code> directory (from your Assignment 2).</p>
<p>For this assignment, you are allowed to use jQuery.</p>
<p>Programming should be done on your local computer.</p>
<p class="note">You are not allowed to create additional stylesheets or HTML files.</p>

<h2>Viewing Your Work</h2>
<p>Open the <code>index.html</code> file on a web browser on your web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, the latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer)</p>
<p class="note">For obvious reasons, you are not allowed to make your work publicly accessibly on the web --yet.</p>

<!-- So I ripped this off from Norman Ramsey at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/details.html -->
<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Every assignment shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (thus <code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (thus <code>README.md</code>). No other formats will be accepted.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The Late Policy</h2>
<p>Homework that is submitted electronically (most homework) will typically be due at 11:59 PM on a Monday or Wednesday or at 5:59 PM on a Friday. We will grant an automatic extension of ten minutes at no cost to you. If you plan on submitting your work at midnight or at six, you will have nine minutes for last-minute changes.</p>
<p>Homework is expected to be submitted on time. However, we recognize that the exigencies of college life occasionally interfere with on-time submission. If you have difficulty getting homework in on time, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ordinary difficulties, each student is automatically issued six "extension tokens." By expending an extension token, you can get an automatic 24-hour extension on all deadlines associated with a single assignment.  To use an extension token, you must e-mail me at <code>mchow@cs.tufts.edu</code>. Thus must be sent before the assignment is due.  At most two extension tokens may be expended on any single assignment.  When you are out of tokens, late homework will no longer be accepted: it will be returned ungraded, and you will receive no credit for the work.</li>
<li>If a serious illness affects your ability to complete homework on time, your first step is to report the illness using the "Illness Notification Form" that is available in WebCenter for Students. We will make suitable arrangements. For extraordinary difficulties, such as bereavement, family emergencies, or other extraordinary unpleasant events, your first step should be to make contact with your associate dean for undergraduate education. You must take this step before the assignment is due. Ask your dean to drop me an email or give me a call, and we will make special arrangements that are suited to your circumstances.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please understand that extension tokens are meant to be used.  That is, you will not receive any special bonus at the end of the course if you do not use any of your extension tokens.</p>
<p>Solutions to assignments and labs will not be posted for this course.</p>

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>
<p>Same as Assignment 2. Push all your changes to the private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>frogger</code>.  Say that your private repository is named <code>mchow-comp20</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>mchow-comp20/frogger</code>.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<li>(-2 points) No <code>README</code></li>
