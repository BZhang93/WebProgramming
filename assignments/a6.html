<h2><span class="note">ABSOLUTELY NO SUBMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER TUESDAY, April 30th!</span></h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Perform a security assessment on a potentially vulnerable web application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>So you completed the ScoreCenter application (<a href="a5.html">Assignment 5</a>).  Unfortunately, it is riddled with security vulnerabilities, undermining the growth and integrity of the product.  Assume that you have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security issues in the application.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You will be assigned an Assignment 5 deliverable by another student in the class to penetration test and analyze (see below).  You are also free to collaborate with the student on all matters.  Your goal is to break the application --that is, find as many security problems as you can.  You <span class="stress">must find at least three (3) vulnerabilities in the other students' product.</span>  You are also allowed to use security tools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project" target="_blank">OWASP WebScarab</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.parosproxy.org/" target="_blank">Paros</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="stress">It is not necessary for you to use any of the security tools listed above but a good idea nonetheless.</span>  The only deliverable for this portion of the assignment is a security assessment document in HTML5 format in your private GitHub repository: <code>security/report.html</code> in the <code>gh-pages</code> and <code>master</code> branches.  Your document must have the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="stress">Introduction</span> - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do</li>
<li><span class="stress">Methodology</span> - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used</li>
<li><span class="stress">Abstract of Findings</span> - Provide an overview of all the security issues you identified.  This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document.  Write this section using lay language.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Issues Found</span> - For each issue that you find, document:
<ul>
<li>Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)</li>
<li>Location / page where issue was found</li>
<li>Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high).  Justify your answer.</li>
<li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is excellent.</li>
<li>Resolution.  How did you resolve the issue? <span class="stress">Show code if possible</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="stress">Conclusion</span> - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Every assignment shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (thus <code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (thus <code>README.md</code>). No other formats will be accepted.</li>
</ol>

<!-- So I ripped this off from Norman Ramsey at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/details.html -->
<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The Late Policy</h2>
<p>Homework that is submitted electronically (most homework) will typically be due at 11:59 PM on a Monday or Wednesday or at 5:59 PM on a Friday. We will grant an automatic extension of ten minutes at no cost to you. If you plan on submitting your work at midnight or at six, you will have nine minutes for last-minute changes.</p>
<p>Homework is expected to be submitted on time. However, we recognize that the exigencies of college life occasionally interfere with on-time submission. If you have difficulty getting homework in on time, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ordinary difficulties, each student is automatically issued six "extension tokens." By expending an extension token, you can get an automatic 24-hour extension on all deadlines associated with a single assignment.  To use an extension token, you must e-mail me at <code>mchow@cs.tufts.edu</code>. Thus must be sent before the assignment is due.  At most two extension tokens may be expended on any single assignment.  When you are out of tokens, late homework will no longer be accepted: it will be returned ungraded, and you will receive no credit for the work.</li>
<li>If a serious illness affects your ability to complete homework on time, your first step is to report the illness using the "Illness Notification Form" that is available in WebCenter for Students. We will make suitable arrangements. For extraordinary difficulties, such as bereavement, family emergencies, or other extraordinary unpleasant events, your first step should be to make contact with your associate dean for undergraduate education. You must take this step before the assignment is due. Ask your dean to drop me an email or give me a call, and we will make special arrangements that are suited to your circumstances.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please understand that extension tokens are meant to be used.  That is, you will not receive any special bonus at the end of the course if you do not use any of your extension tokens.</p>
<p>Solutions to assignments and labs will not be posted for this course.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>I will be assessing your document based on its breadth and depth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Introduction</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Methodology</li>
<li><strong>(2 points)</strong> - Abstract of Findings</li>
<li><strong>(2 points)</strong> - Issues Found</li>
<li><strong>(2 points)</strong> - Technical analysis of issues found</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Conclusion</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - <code>README</code> document exists; report is named <code>report.html</code> in folder named <code>security</code> in private GitHub repo in <code>gh-pages</code> and <code>master</code> branches</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>
<p>Push all your changes to the private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>security</code> to both your <code>gh-pages</code> and <code>master</code> branches.  Say that your private repository is named <code>mchow-comp20</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>mchow-comp20/security</code>.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can identify multiple instances of a security issue in your document.  Example: cross-site scripting on two different sections of the web application.</li>
<li>It is important that you <span class="stress">read</span> your partner's source code!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p class="directions">Q: Are we supposed to read the downloaded source code in order to make our attacks on the site we are attacking?  Or should we try to do it without going through the source code?  I'm not sure how to tell my attacks are working.</p>
<p>A: Two step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, perform attacks WITHOUT reading the source code!  This is also known as "black box" testing.</li>
<li>Then, download or get from your partner, the source code of the application.  Peruse through it, perform a code review of it (by hand and/or by a scanner such as RATS), and document for your findings.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find anything glaring, then go back to the application and attack it.  This is also known as "white box" testing.  For example, after you read the source code for the search function and you are suspicious that you can perform a SQL injection attack to delete a table (also given the database structure from your partner), go ahead an try it out :-)</p>

<p class="directions">Q: Is it necessary to use all the programs listed above? I'm having trouble running Burp suite and RATS specifically. I was able to get a good amount of information from Paros and from looking at the source code, though.</p>
<p>A: No.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: I'm using Paros and it gave me back a URL under alerts.  Does that mean it tried a SQL injection and worked?</p>
<p>A: Perhaps.  It could also be a false positive.  You have to check in the database (in this case, ask your partner), if it went through.  However, this is something that you can document.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: If Paros doesn't give me back any alerts when spidering through something, does that mean that it hasn't found any, or that I don't know how to use the application?</p>
<p>A: If Paros doesn't return anything, it didn't find anything.  But any good security practitioner would know that you cannot depend on a (especially just one) scanning tool, run it, and call it a day.  I believe that the XSS that I performed on Sarah's application was not detected in Paros --so that should tell you something.  Now, a more reliable and ruthless method would be to use IBM (formerly Watchfire's) AppScan: <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/appscan/" target="_blank">http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/appscan/</a>.  It is not free, but arguably the best scanner money can buy.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: I can't find any problems with my partner's application.  What should I do?</p>
<p>A: You can make recommendations (and I find it hard to believe that you cannot find problems).  Example: if you notice that your partner's web application uses the insecure methods, you can recommend to upgrade application to use more secure options.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: Is there an example of a good report?</p>
<p>A: See this gold standard from a dear former student, Shilpa Nadimpalli (spring 2011): <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~snadim02/comp20/a5/" target="_blank">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~snadim02/comp20/a5/</a>.</p>
