<h2>2013 Semester Group Project</h2>

<section id="main-content">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You will be working on a team of 4 or 5 people (see below) to create a product pertaining to, or complementing, <span class="def">vehicles</span>.  Legitimate vehicles include planes, trains, automobile, and bikes.  The foot does not constitute as a vehicle.  Things complementing vehicles include stops and stations.</p>

<h2>Goal of Semester Group Project</h2>
<p class="stress">Have students work in a team to define a problem and build a solution.</p>

<h2>Past Semester Group Project Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fall 2011 (Web Engineering): Health</li>
<li>Spring 2011: Retail</li>
<li>Fall 2010: Personal Finance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>A way to promote sharing private parking spots in a parking lot with a limited number of spaces.</li>
<li>A rental system for private parking spots.</li>
<li>A bike rack locator.</li>
<li>A way to shame those who use objects (e.g., chairs) to save a parking space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Cannot Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>A blog</li>
<li>A message board</li>
<li>A calculator of some sort</li>
<li>A website to help you find the nearest watering hole / liquor store / Starbucks / etc.  Been there, done that.</li>
<li>A site to find directions. That's what Google Maps, MapQuest, etc. are for.</li>
<li>An MBTA subway or bus tracker. You essentially did that in Assignment 3!</li>
<li>A ride sharing application (including carpooling). This idea is too saturated and quite frankly, way too sketchy.</li>
<li>A shortest path finder. Ugh!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Absolute Requirements</h2>
<p>The product that your team creates must adhere to the following non-negotiable requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The product must use HTML5.</li>
<li>The product must use JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax.</li>
<li>The team must use <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for the project.  Each team will be provided a private repo.</li>
<li>The product must have desktop and mobile web user interfaces.  That is, the user interface is different on the desktop than on mobile.</li>
<li>The product must allow users to login and save some data.</li>
<li>The product must allow users to "delete" their account with the option of resurrecting it in 30 days.</li>
<li>The product must use server-side data persistence (e.g., with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)</li>
<li>The product must use a server-side framework or technology (e.g., Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PHP)</li>
<li>The product must use least 2 APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Twitter, Facebook, Evernote) with JSON and/or XML parsing</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pick Five</h2>
<p>On top of the absolute requirements, the product must use (at least) five of the following technologies or ideas (your team's choice):</p>
<ul>
<li>Geolocation</li>
<li>Front-end framework including Bootstrap</li>
<li>Data / screen scraping</li>
<li>File upload and sharing</li>
<li>Reporting with charts and graphs</li>
<li>Custom search.  Simply incorporating a Google search box on your product is not allowed</li>
<li>Data storage in the clouds (e.g., Amazon AWS, Dropbox)</li>
<li>Send emails and/or SMSes (e.g., Twilio)</li>
<li>Client-side data persistence with either local storage or web SQL</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li><span class="def">Project proposal and design doc (15 points; <span class="note">due on Thursday, Pi Day</span>)</span>.  <span class="stress">In text format and using bullet-points:</span>
<ul>
<li>Title of product</li>
<li>Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?)</li>
<li>How do you solve the problem?</li>
<li>List of all the features that your team <span class="stress">will</span> implement (including which of the "Pick 5" items were chosen by the team). Your team will be held accountable for the features you list!</li>
<li>What data will your product be collecting and using</li>
<li>Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary</li>
<li>Electronic mockups of the product.  No hand-drawn mockups accepted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="def">Product checkup (15 points; <span class="note">due on Tuesday, April 9th</span>)</span></li>
<li><span class="def">The completed product (30 points; <span class="note">due on Friday, May 3rd at 12 PM</span>)</span></li>
<li><span class="def">Elevator pitch presentation (5 points; <span class="note">on Friday, May 3rd at 12 PM</span>)</span> - You have less than 5 minutes to explain your product to me and to the judges!  This is your final exam block.  Room and location TBD.  Food will most likely be provided.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All works and ideas are owned by the members of the team.  I cannot take ownership of any of your work.  I do not have stake or equity in any project created in my classes for that matter.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can add to the list of "Pick 5" or "Ideas" at any time.</li>
<li>Your team is allowed to change direction or scope of the project but your team will need to submit a new project proposal / design doc and no time extension will be given.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Your team will be graded on five factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="stress">Functionality</span> - Something that works consistently. Remember, an app with fewer features that work is significantly better than one with numerous features, in which some either do not work or are buggy.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Utility</span> - Does your product fulfill a recognized need?  Is it also easy to understand?</li>
<li><span class="stress">Originality</span> - C'mon, another Joey Tracker?  Better if your team strives to do something more cosmic.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Technical Competency</span> - Use <a href="http://kotaku.com/5975610/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code" target="_blank">good programming practices</a>, consistent git commits and pushes, meaningful git commit messages used.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Teamwork</span> - Does all team members contribute?  Having one or two people doing all the work is not good.  <span class="note">On the last day of class, Thursday, April 25th, every person will conduct a performance review on each teammate!</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>Please complete this questionnaire so I can determine teams: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hg8zWiCmOBEBgxL1JJePOgAklxLb6_OU5s3NGUBfPB8/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hg8zWiCmOBEBgxL1JJePOgAklxLb6_OU5s3NGUBfPB8/viewform</a></p>
