<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use JSON APIs.</li>
<li>Build a mashup.</li>
<li>Use the Google Maps API.</li>
<li>Use the HTML5 geolocation API to determine your location.</li>
<li>Use and understand with event handling and exception handling.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You are to build a single page that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maps all the stations on the Red Line using Google Maps API version 3.  A distinct icon marker (i.e., something other than the default Google Maps icon for markers) must be used for all stations, and a red polyline connecting all the stations must be rendered. Clicking on a marker will display an info window with the name of the station.</li>
<li>Detects and maps your current location via <code>navigator.geolocation</code> JavaScript object.  An info window marking your location (e.g., "I am here at...") must be attached to your marker and displayed on the map.</li>
<li>Displays the closest Red Line station to your current location with approximate distance away (in miles).</li>
<li>Clicking on a subway station marker will display an info window with the name of the station and arrival schedule (southbound and northbound) for each station on the Red Line.</li>
<li>Retrieves and displays the locations of Carmen Sandiego <img src="../images/carmen.png" alt="Carmen"/> and Waldo <img src="../images/waldo.png" alt="Waldo"/>.</li>
<li>Displays the distance (in miles) between you and Carmen Sandiego, and you and Waldo.  You can display this as an overlay on top of map or on a side of the map.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions and Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a folder inside of your private GitHub repo named <code>where</code>. <span class="note">DO NOT RUN <code>git init</code> inside of it!</span>.</li>
<li>One HTML file is required inside of the <code>where</code> folder: <code>index.html</code>.  You should not have to write too much HTML.</li>
<li>You must write all JavaScript code in a separate file.  The file must end in <code>.js</code> extension.  Do not write any JavaScript in the <code>index.html</code> file other than one line that loads your <code>.js</code> file!  You can name this <code>.js</code> file anything that you like.</li>
<li>You must use at least one CSS file. The file must end in <code>.css</code> extension.  You can name this <code>.css</code> file anything that you like.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Official List of MBTA Subway Stations</h2>
<p><a href="http://developer.mbta.com/RT_Archive/RealTimeHeavyRailKeys.csv" target="_blank">http://developer.mbta.com/RT_Archive/RealTimeHeavyRailKeys.csv</a> is the official comma-separated values (CSV) file that lists all the Red Line, Orange Line, and Blue Line stations (sorry, no Green Line).  We are only concerned with the Red Line stations for this assignment.  It is important to note that each station has a southbound and a northbound key which is critical for the real-time Red Line schedule API (next).  You can assume this set of data relatively static (i.e., doesn't change often), thus, you can hard-code some of the information into your script.</p>

<h2>APIs</h2>
<p>This assignment will require the use of three external APIs:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://mbtamap-cedar.herokuapp.com/mapper/redline.json" target="_blank">http://mbtamap-cedar.herokuapp.com/mapper/redline.json</a> - The real time schedule API <span class="stress">in JSON format</span> (taken from the official source at <a href="http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/developers/default.asp?id=21898" target="_blank">http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/developers/default.asp?id=21898</a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/a3.json" target="_blank">http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/a3.json</a> - Returns a JSON containing the locations of Waldo and Carmen Sandiego.  At times, only the location of Waldo may be returned; or just the location of Carmen Sandiego; or the locations of both Waldo and Carmen Sandiego; or something slimy!</li>
<li>The Google Maps API.  Please refer to my notes at <a href="../lecture_notes/ajax.html">http://tuftsdev.github.com/WebProgramming/lecture_notes/ajax.html</a>.  Working examples are available at <a href="https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/tree/spring2013/google_maps">https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/tree/spring2013/google_maps</a>. <span class="note">NOTES: the <code>geolocation_map.html</code> example requires the page to be on a web server (see below or push a copy of it with corresponding CSS to your special repo <code>username.github.com</code>).  Also, you do not need to create an API key to use Google Maps API version 3.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="note">Important: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled for both APIs above!</p>

<h2>The Haversine Formula: The Distance Between Two (Geo)Points</h2>
<p>To calculate the distance between two geopoints (latitude and longitude), you must use the Haversine Formula.  The formula is provided and analyzed at <a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html" target="_blank">http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html</a>.  Also, you can refer to this on Stack Overflow: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript</a>.</p>

<h2>Viewing Your Work</h2>
<p>Using the JavaScript Geolocation API requires a web server.  Therefore, simply opening the <code>index.html</code> page on a web browser will not work for this assignment.  Fortunately, we have a development server named <code>kublai</code> that will allow you to view your work <span class="stress">privately</span> (that is, so other students cannot view your work).  Anything in one's <code>~/dev_html</code> directory gets served at <code>http://kublai/~user</code> in Halligan, with the same kind of permissions as in <code>public_html</code>.  What you will need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read about SSH port forwarding at <a href="http://www.debianadmin.com/howto-use-ssh-local-and-remote-port-forwarding.html" target="_blank">http://www.debianadmin.com/howto-use-ssh-local-and-remote-port-forwarding.html</a></li>
<li>SSH into <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu</code></li>
<li>Create a new directory named <code>dev_html</code> in your home directory (e.g., <code>mkdir dev_html</code>)</li>
<li>Change the permissions of the <code>dev_html</code> directory to <code>755</code> (e.g., <code>chmod 755 dev_html</code>)</li>
<li>Log out <code>linux.cs.tufts.edu</code></li>
<li>Copy all your files to your <code>dev_html</code> directory.  You can use FileZilla or <code>scp</code> for this.  To learn more about the <code>scp</code> command, RTFM via <code>man scp</code></li>
<li>Once you copy all your files to your <code>dev_html</code> directory, make sure that all files are set to permissions <code>644</code> and all folders are set to permissions <code>755</code></li>
<li>To see your work on the development server <span class="stress">on the browser of your computer</span>, run <code>ssh -L localhost:8888:kublai:80 <span class="stress">your_tufts_cs_login</span>@linux.cs.tufts.edu</code> first.  Then on your browser, go to <code>http://localhost:8888/~<span class="stress">your_tufts_cs_login</span></code></li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Every assignment shall include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (thus <code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (thus <code>README.md</code>). No other formats will be accepted.</li>
</ol>

<!-- So I ripped this off from Norman Ramsey at http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/details.html -->
<h2><span class="note">(Course Policy)</span> The Late Policy</h2>
<p>Homework that is submitted electronically (most homework) will typically be due at 11:59 PM on a Monday or Wednesday or at 5:59 PM on a Friday. We will grant an automatic extension of ten minutes at no cost to you. If you plan on submitting your work at midnight or at six, you will have nine minutes for last-minute changes.</p>
<p>Homework is expected to be submitted on time. However, we recognize that the exigencies of college life occasionally interfere with on-time submission. If you have difficulty getting homework in on time, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ordinary difficulties, each student is automatically issued six "extension tokens." By expending an extension token, you can get an automatic 24-hour extension on all deadlines associated with a single assignment.  To use an extension token, you must e-mail me at <code>mchow@cs.tufts.edu</code>. Thus must be sent before the assignment is due.  At most two extension tokens may be expended on any single assignment.  When you are out of tokens, late homework will no longer be accepted: it will be returned ungraded, and you will receive no credit for the work.</li>
<li>If a serious illness affects your ability to complete homework on time, your first step is to report the illness using the "Illness Notification Form" that is available in WebCenter for Students. We will make suitable arrangements. For extraordinary difficulties, such as bereavement, family emergencies, or other extraordinary unpleasant events, your first step should be to make contact with your associate dean for undergraduate education. You must take this step before the assignment is due. Ask your dean to drop me an email or give me a call, and we will make special arrangements that are suited to your circumstances.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please understand that extension tokens are meant to be used.  That is, you will not receive any special bonus at the end of the course if you do not use any of your extension tokens.</p>
<p>Solutions to assignments and labs will not be posted for this course.</p>

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>
<p>Push all the files to the private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>where</code>.  Say that your private repository is named <code>mchow-comp20</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>mchow-comp20/where</code>.</p>
